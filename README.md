# covidscraper

John Hopkins University publishes everyday current and historic information about SARSCOV-II/COVID-19 pandemia in the world.
The following project is an excercise of a scrapper that will retrieve statistical information from their website.

## Built With
‚Äã
- Ruby 2.6.5
- Google Chrome 84 
- Chromedriver 84

## Requirements

### The following Gems are required
- nokogiri 1.10.10
- watir 6.17.0
- open-uri
- awesome_print 1.8.0
- pry 0.13.1

They are included in a Gemfile and can be installed with Bundler.

### Testing
Testing was performed with Rspec 3.9

### Chromedriver 
Chrome driver is required by Watir to fetch web pages.
Follow instructions from: `https://chromedriver.chromium.org/`.

Quick tip:
After downloading the corresponding version for your Chrome browser, unpack the file and copy it to a location in your path or add its current location to it.

## Getting Started

‚ÄãGet a local copy:‚Äã 

`git clone https://github.com/gdumani/covidscaper`

In the covid scrapper directory install the required gems:

`bundle install` 


## Commands
In the bin directory 

`ruby covidscraper.rb`

## Intructions

The program has two main functions for which corresponig objects exist:
 ### rgn 
 It retrieves the link of a location. When the program starts, it will fetch all the regions and their available links and classify them in two groups, `us` and `world`. Each group is stored in standard Hash format `{ location => link , location => link , ...}` and accepts normal ruby Hash commands. Additional `country` and `state` methods are provided to retrive single entries from 'world' an 'us' regions respectively. Examples:
  - `rgn.us` => all US links .
  - `rgn.world` => all WORLD links.
  - `rgn.country 'Ireland'` => Hash with link for Ireland.
  - `rgn.state 'Colorado'` => Hash with link for US state Colorado.
  
### scrap
It uses a browser instance created by Watir gem to retrieve the information for a given `{ location => link, location => link ...}` hash. the information is stored in hash format. `extract` with a hash argument triggers the brower to fetch the information and stores it in `result` for futher analisys. This approach was used to let the browser do de processing of the data retrieving scripts in the website. It scans all historical information by instructing the browser to click on the specific text. Examples:
  - `scrap.extract rgn.world`
  - `scrap.extract rgn.us`
  - `scrap.extract rgn.country "Canada"`
  - `scrap.extract rgn.state "Ohio"`
  - `scrap.result`
  - `scrap.result[ location-key ]` location-key can be a state or country depending on data in `result`.
  Because `result` is a multilevel hash it can be digged down using hash keys and hash tools.
  AwesomePrint is integrated to facilitate data presentation. Example
   - `ap scrap.result`

## Instructions to test with Rspec

Go to the directory where TicTacToe is installed according to the getting started previous instructions and install Rspec. 

- To install rspec run: `gem install rspec`

- To run curren tests just type: `rspec` 

New test can be added in ./spec/main_spec.rb file following the Rspec guidelines.

## Program Files

  - /bin/covscraper.rb   :main program
  - /lib/regions_hash.rb :RegionJhu class that fetches link
  - /lib/scrap.rb        :ScrapJhu class that uses browser to retrieve data
  - /lib/modules.rb      :filter module to remove html tags from strings

## Future improvements

- Add a menu-driven user interface.
- Replace Watir for another HTML tool that queries data directly whithout the requirement of a full Web browser like Chrome. As an excercise it does the job by letting Chrome deal with active code. It is extremly useful for testing WWW aplications and to symulate user interactions. In this scenario it uses a high amount of resources and has a big performance toll.
